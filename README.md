# FOCUS CARDS

A minimalist, fullscreen web application for managing tasks, chores, exercises, and any other items you want to focus on. Built with a clean black and white design that helps you stay focused on what matters.

## 👋 A Personal Note from the Creator

Hi there! This is my first app, and I'm excited to share it with you. 

The idea for FOCUS CARDS came from my own daily struggles with getting things done. I found myself using physical study cards to break down my morning routines, workout sessions, and daily chores into manageable pieces. When I couldn't get into my morning groove, I'd pull out my "morning motivation" cards. When I needed to work out, I had a dedicated set for that too.

I wanted to capture that hands-on, tactile feeling of flipping through physical cards in a digital tool that's simple, intuitive, and actually helps you focus. No overwhelming features, no complex interfaces—just the essential workflow that makes study cards so effective. However, there are a lot of invisible features, that you can read about in the documentation or just find out by using the thing.

The app is available both as a simple HTML file you can open in any browser and as a Windows 11 executable, so you can use it however works best for your workflow.

I hope this tool helps you tackle your daily tasks with the same clarity and focus that those physical cards gave me!
